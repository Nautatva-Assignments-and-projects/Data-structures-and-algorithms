Arrays --> deadly supported by programming languages
Stack === Array implementation
Queue -> circular

Arrays:
  Memory: Amount if memory in bytes is given at declaration time
  Operation: Array reference
    Cost: O(1)
      Why cost O(1)?
        Address of A[i] === Î± + i*b   //directly find the address and thus cost 1.

//heterogeneous class elements
